# HTML-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Shivani Ananya, and this repository is a collection of projects I built while learning HTML. As part of my web development journey, I wanted to create a dedicated space to apply and practice the concepts I’ve learned in a hands-on way.
Each file and folder is organized based on the topics covered, and I’ve added comments within the code to explain the purpose of different sections, making it easy for anyone else viewing the code to follow along.

This is a beginner-level portfolio, but I’m proud of these small milestones as they mark important steps in my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. I’ll be updating this repository with more projects as I continue learning.
FYI- the information and text provided are fake. This entire project is been built for my own knowledge

Thank you for visiting my portfolio — feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
