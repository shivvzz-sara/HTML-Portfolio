<h1> FAVORITE MOVIE ACCORDING TO ME </h1>
<h2> Top 3 movies of all times </h2>

<hr/>

<h3> TO ALL THE BOYS THAT I LOVED BEFORE</h3>
<p> this is my favorite movie because it has shown love is not something that can be forced, but something that develops over the time. </p>
<h3> YOU ARE SO NOT INVITED TO MY BAT-MITZIVAH</h3>
<p> this is an amazing story line betwee two friends who had a clash. but friendship isnt always about hate right? so they way they get ack together moved me so much. </p>
<h3> TERMINATOR </h3>
<p> this is a movie that has been my favorite since childhood. the way the story is written and the way the characters are portrayed is just amazing. </p>
